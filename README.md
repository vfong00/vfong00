### Hello world... ðŸ‘‹

---

I'm a junior at Cornell studying computer science and operations research. My academic/technical interests are with machine learning applications; specifically, computer vision and vision systems.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me experiencing the trials and tribulations of New York sports fandom, playing video games, or watching the Great British Bake Off.
